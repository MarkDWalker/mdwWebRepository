            Views of Kenwood Subdivision 
        </div>
        <div class = cardBody> Views of Kenwood Subdivision involved the redevelopment of a partially developed multi-family site into 11 single family lots. 
        </div>
        
        <div class = cardBody> 
            The site is located in the City of Cincinnati on Kenwood Road. The steep slopes presented a special challenge for the design of storm water detention as the site is located on the side of the hill. The creative solution of utilizing concrete retaining walls to create the pond served to minimize the area required for detention and maximize the area available for lots and amentities.
