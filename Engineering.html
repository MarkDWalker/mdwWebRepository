            Parkland Meadows is a subdivision newly created in Loveland, Ohio. This subdivision involved the design of 16 lots on approximately 8 acres and utilized a public street and public utilities to serve the community.

        <div class = cardBody> 
            Our team was able to efficiently utilize the flatter portions of the property, and at the same time leave over 4 acres of open space, to minimize the impact of the development and maintain the existing park like setting of the area.

        <div class = cardBody> Views of Kenwood Subdivision involved the redevelopment of a partially developed multi-family site into 11 single family lots. 
        </div>
        
        <div class = cardBody> 
            The site is located in the City of Cincinnati on Kenwood Road. The steep slopes presented a special challenge for the design of storm water detention as the site is located on the side of the hill. The creative solution of utilizing concrete retaining walls to create the pond served to minimize the area required for detention and maximize the area available for lots and amentities.
